# keras_model_comparison
In this notebook I built a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then made experiments by increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers to see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.

A dataset is used to predict concrete compressive strength. The predictors in the data of concrete strength include:
- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
